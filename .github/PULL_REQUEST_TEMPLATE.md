**Deliverable Submission**

Please describe your comfort and completeness levels before submitting.

Comfort Level (1-5): 
3ish with basic stuff until everything fell apart so I'd say 2. I had the HTML going okay before my JS seemed to not be working and I remade the temperature-converter-dom folder. 
Definitely had trouble with the event listeners.
They HTML was much closer to the picture before I tried to add functions on the bottom that trashed the look to it.
Everything was going better than it looks now until I tried integrating Kelvin. When everything went to crud I tried taking the Kelvins out of the function and it got even worse. 

Completeness Level (1-5):
2.
What did you think of this deliverable?:
Definitely a good test on cross-concepts and making things interactive for the user.
